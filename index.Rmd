## Bio

Jenna Morris (she/her) is a forest ecologist passionate about supporting climate adaptation through actionable science for sustainable resource management. Currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Harvey Lab at the University of Washington, her work explores the effects of disturbances (fire, insect outbreaks) on forests in the Pacific Northwest and Rocky Mountains, leveraging field studies, permanent plot networks, and simulation modeling to improve our ability to maintain resilient forest structure and function in a changing climate. Jenna’s current research focuses on anticipating post-fire forest recovery across the Cascades under future climate and management scenarios.
