Currently a PhD Candidate in the Harvey Lab at the University of Washington, her graduate work explores the effects of disturbances (e.g., fire, insect outbreaks) on forests in the Pacific Northwest and Rocky Mountains, leveraging field studies, permanent plot networks, and landscape modeling to improve our ability to maintain resilient forest structure and function in a changing climate. Jennaâ€™s current research focuses on anticipating post-fire forest recovery in northwestern Cascadia under future climate and management scenarios.
